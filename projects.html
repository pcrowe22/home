    <h2>MATLAB</h2>
    <p>Though I did some programming in MATLAB my freshman year, I do not regularly use it now.</p>
    <p>I did, however, develop some pretty cool interactive charts for calculating student loan debt and investment options.
      Check them out if you have a MATLAB environment!</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p>Sophomore Year I broke into some more Java and built some software that updates and performs computations on
      a spreadsheet of L stations. You can edit the number of stations in the table and compute the shortest route
      between two points!</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/projects/CTA_App.jar" download>Executable Jar</a></li>
        <li><a href="/projects/CTA_App.zip" download>Zipped folder</a></li>
        <li><a href="/projects/CTA_App/CTAStops.csv" download>L Station Spreadsheet</a> <em>(Note: you need this to run the .jar, just specify where you downloaded the file when the program asks you)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a Junior, I developed two java programs.</p>
    <p>The first one I designed in conjunction with two of my classmates through GitHub (you can find our repository among my other
      one repositories for the code listed here on my <a href="https://github.com/pcrowe22">GitHub</a>.) We built a parking meter program with Java and
      PostgreSQL that features many options such as reserving your spot or running a report on monthly income for admin users.
      Permissions are enforced and transactions are atomic.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/projects/ParkBase_App.jar" download>Executable Jar</a></li>
        <li><a href="/projects/ParkBase.zip" download>Zipped folder</a></li>
        <li><a href="/projects/data.zip" download>Tables for SQL database</a> <em>(Note: you need this to run the program. The software will read the csvs and create SQL tables with them.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>My second project was developed independently. It also uses SQL databases, but instead functions as help ticket software.
      You can make requests, mark them as canceled, or edit them while they're in the database.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/projects/Tickets_FA20_runnable.jar" download>Executable Jar</a></li>
        <li><a href="/projects/Tickets_FA20_PC.zip" download>Zipped folder</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally, the project I'm most proud of and use most is my node tracer app. The need for this came about as I was
      exploring rabbit holes online and I kept getting lost. This software works for a particular website, <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/">SCP Containment Breach</a>
      but I hope to expand its use for more. I'm able to blacklist certain links that blow up the stack trace and ignore
      parts of the webpage that I know aren't relevant. I'm even working on save functionality that can save the traced links
      in a nested structure that can be collapsed so that the text isn't too overwhelming to look at. Try it out for yourself if you
      enjoy going down rabbit holes on the SCP database.</p>

        <li><a href="/projects/Scraper_NoTree.jar" download>Without Tree Functionality</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Unity</h2>
    <p>I almost forgot to mention that I was part of the VandyHacks 2021 Hackathon during the pandemic. Me and a group of 3 other guys
      tried building an AR app that demonstrates chemical bonding through 3D models and ID cards. Turns out our computers were too
      slow to simulate much, but not long after I built my own computer so that I could add as much RAM as I needed while 
      writing and designing simulations with high-graphics. Take a look if you're interested.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Groovy</h2>
    <p>I'm still writing the packages I'd like to put here. Should have some good stuff by the end of this semester!</p>
    <h2>Swift</h2>
    <p>I'm part of a group of students tasked with coding the controller for a remote telescop interface. This has been an ongoing
      project for years so I likely won't have a link for you to download the package directly from me, but in some short years I may
      have a repository I can link you to so that you can see the work me and the students at IIT have accomplished. Updates to come!</p>
